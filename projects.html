                        <h3>QUEUE MANAGEMENT SOLUTION</h3>
                        <p id="hdet">Now a days time is money. The waiting time in queues for appointments can be made productive by using some simple solutions. This project is chosen because of my personal experience during vaccination. The product we thought of preparing is a website for providing our queue management solutions for our clients. The website just consists of request for solution, status check for request and suggestion box for mutual prosperity. The solution is mainly composed of python coding and some online packages like ‘Twilio’. We provide tokens for customers and save their mobile numbers based on the token number given to them. So, when a customer with smaller token number is availing their appointment time then a message can be sent to other customer in queue with token number higher than present one. Here the most complex part is sending messages using online packages which is very difficult. This part can be done by some other packages like ‘way2sms’. Our project unlike existing ones also trying to provide some other like rescheduling and cancelling appointments.</p>
